Hi! I’m **Yan Feng (冯岩)**, a **PhD candidate (Year 2)** at **Chang’an University**, affiliated with the **Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Research Institute**.

My research focuses on **AI security for recommender systems**, with an emphasis on **poisoning attack detection**, **anomaly forensics**, and **reliability/stability-aware security mechanisms**. Recently, I am also extending these security studies to **traffic route recommendation systems**, aiming to build **controllable, stability-aware, and explainable** defenses in closed-loop transportation scenarios.

## Research Interests
- **Recommender System Security**: poisoning attacks, collusion, anomaly detection, forensic analysis  
- **Robust / Explainable Detection**: multi-level (node/edge/graph) evidence alignment and interpretable auditing  
- **Stability-aware Security**: stability verification and stability-gated detection triggering (e.g., Lyapunov-inspired analysis)  
- **Traffic Route Recommendation (Application)**: preference-aware recommendation with dynamic traffic contexts and security evaluation

## Publications (Selected)
- **IEEE TKDE (Survey)**: *Attacks and Detections in Recommender Systems: A Comprehensive Analysis for Models, Progresses, and Trends*  
- **IEEE TDSC**: *Meet Trick With Trick: Revealing Collusion Intentions in Highly Concealed Poisoning Behavior*  
- **Under Review / In Revision**: topics on high-concealment injection detection, stability-aware detection, and personalized adversarial defense

> Full list: please see the **Publications** tab (and/or my CV).

## Visiting Plan (CSC)
I am preparing a **CSC Visiting PhD** application (12 months). My goal is to conduct collaborative research on **security and robustness of recommender systems**, and to advance **traffic route recommendation security** with stability-aware and explainable detection.
