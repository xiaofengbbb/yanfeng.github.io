Hi! I’m **Yan Feng (冯岩)**, a **Ph.D. candidate (Year 2)** at **Chang’an University**, affiliated with the **School of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence**.

My research focuses on **AI security for recommender systems**, with an emphasis on **poisoning attack detection**, **anomaly forensics**, and **reliability and stability-aware security mechanisms**. Recently, I have also extended these security studies to **traffic route recommendation systems**, aiming to build **controllable, stability-aware, and explainable** defenses in closed-loop transportation scenarios.

## Research Interests
- **Recommender System Security**
- **Robust / Explainable Detection**
- **Stability-aware Security**
- **Traffic Route Recommendation (Application)**

## Publications (Selected)
- **IEEE TKDE (Survey)**: *Attacks and Detections in Recommender Systems: A Comprehensive Analysis for Models, Progresses, and Trends*  
- **IEEE TDSC**: *Meet Trick With Trick: Revealing Collusion Intentions in Highly Concealed Poisoning Behavior*  



## Visiting Plan (CSC)
I am preparing a **CSC Visiting PhD** application (12 months). My goal is to conduct collaborative research on **security and robustness of recommender systems**, and to advance **traffic route recommendation security** with stability-aware and explainable detection.

## Emotional Supporter 🐶

Meet my emotional supporter — **Biaobiao (彪彪)**, a Corgi.  
He keeps me motivated and reminds me to stay positive during research.
